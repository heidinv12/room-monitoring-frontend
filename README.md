# ES6 Starter Kit

Starter app for small Javascript projects. Includes:

- Webpack
- Sass
- Babel
- ESLint
- Jest

This is not meant to be a replacement for full Single-Page app start kits, e.g. `create-react-app` and the various Gatsby starters.  This is instead meant for smaller, one-off Javascript projects that could still benefit from the quality-of-life improvements brought by ES6 and other modern JS tooling
